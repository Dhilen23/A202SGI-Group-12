        Discover flexible connectivity by renting a car hourly, daily, weekly, or even monthly, all made
        easy on the Pdz Car Rental app. Our mission is to realise minimise car ownership
        through accessible mobility, and bring impact to a greener society in every part of the country and beyond. To book a car on Turo,
        you must create a Pdz account, be 18 years old or older in the US, 21 years old or older in the UK,
        23 years old or older in Canada, have a valid driver’s license, and get approved to drive on Pdz.
        When you’re booking your first trip, you’ll go through a quick approval process by entering your driver’s
        license and some other information. In most cases, you’ll get approved immediately,
        and you’ll be set for all future road trips, day trips, and business trips!</string>
